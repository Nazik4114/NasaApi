This remarkable picture records the scene with a dreamlike quality from the east coast of the United States. The picture is actually a composite of 10 digital frames made with exposures from 1/500th second to 1 second long, preserving contrast and detail over a much wider than normal range of brightness. At a perigee distance of a mere 356,896 kilometers, August\'s Full Moon was the closest, and so the largest and most super, of the three Full Moons nearest perigee in 2014 now popularly known as supermoons. But if you missed August\'s super supermoon, the next not-quite-so supermoon will be September 8. Then, near the full lunar phase the Moon\'s perigee will be a slightly more distant 358,387 kilometers.

When can I see the Great Conjunction?  Just after sunset.  Since the two planets are so near the Sun directionally, they always appear in the sky near the Sun, but can best be seen when the Earth blocks the Sun but not the planets: sunset.  Soon thereafter, Jupiter and Saturn will also set, so don\'t be late!   Is tomorrow night the only night that I can see the Great Conjunction?  Tomorrow night the jovian giants will appear the closest, but on any night over the next few days they will appear unusually close.

These extremely active comets were bright, naked-eye spectacles offering researchers an opportunity to telescopically explore the composition of primordial chunks of our solar system by studying their long and beautiful tails. But it has only recently been discovered that surprising readings from experiments on-board the interplanetary Ulysses probe which lasted for several hours on May 1, 1996, indicate the probe passed through comet Hyakutake\'s tail! Ulysses experiments were intended to study the Sun and solar wind and the spacecraft-comet encounter was totally unanticipated. Relative positions of Ulysses and Hyakutake on that date indicate that this comet\'s ion tail stretched an impressive 360 million miles or about four times the Earth-Sun distance.

Of course, on that day the Moon rose with the Sun, creating a widely enjoyed partial solar eclipse. Along with a mountainous horizon, the cloud cover lent a dramatic aspect to this eclipse sunrise and made it possible for astronomer Babak Tafreshi to record these telephoto images without using a filter.

Recorded during last month\'s visit by the crew of shuttle orbiter Discovery on mission STS-119, the pictures show extended solar arrays glinting in bright sunlight against a dark sky. They also likely capture the blurred image of a spacewalking astronaut during the mission\'s EVA-2 (Extravehicular Activity-2)! The astronaut is installing equipment along one of the station\'s truss assemblies. Astronomer Ralf Vandebergh, who often images the ISS during its favorable passes through Dutch skies, comments that no other bright ISS structures occupy the position indicated in the inset, and that a reflective, white-suited astronaut would be visible against the truss and correspond to the bright blur.  Vandebergh notes that the timing and location further suggest the spacewalker is STS-119 astronaut Joseph Acaba.   digg_url = \'http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090410.html\'; digg_skin = \'compact\';', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0904/STS-119_EVA-2_20090321_192411.jpg', 'image', 'v1', 'ISS and Astronaut', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0904/STS-119_EVA-2_20090321_192411_c800.jpg'),

Deep Space 1 is bound for asteroid 1992 KD in July 1999.  Although the ion drive on Deep Space 1 provides acceleration much smaller than we feel toward Earth, it will gradually give the spacecraft the speed it needs to travel across our Solar System. The propulsion drive works by ionizing Xenon atoms with power provided by large panels that collect sunlight.  As these ions are expelled by a strong electric field out the back, the spacecraft slowly gains speed.  Pictured above, hot blue ions emerge from a prototype drive that was successfully tested last year at JPL.', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9810/ion_jpl_big.gif', 'image', 'v1', 'An Ion Drive for Deep Space 1', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9810/ion_jpl.jpg'),

The Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard the space-based SOHO observatory recorded this exquisitely detailed image in the light of ionized Helium atoms from its vantage point in a Halo orbit.

We see the disk of the nearby island universe tilted towards our line of sight in this remarkably detailed galaxy portrait, a telescopic view that spans an area about the angular size of a full moon. In it, the giant galaxy\'s elongated yellowish core is dominated by the light from old, cool stars. Beyond the core, grand spiral arms are filled with young blue star clusters and speckled with pinkish star forming regions.

Fondly known as Sagittarius A* (pronounced A-star), the Milky Way\'s black hole is fortunately mild-mannered compared to the central black holes in distant active galaxies, much more calmly consuming material around it. From time to time it does flare-up, though. An outburst lasting several hours is captured in this series of premier X-ray images from the orbiting Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). Launched last June 13, NuSTAR is the first to provide focused views of the area surrounding Sgr A* at X-ray energies higher than those accessible to Chandra and XMM observatories. Spanning two days of NuSTAR observations, the flare sequence is illustrated in the panels at the far right. X-rays are generated in material heated to over 100 million degrees Celsius, accelerated to nearly the speed of light as it falls into the Miky Way\'s central black hole. The main inset X-ray image spans about 100 light-years.

The fog itself is not confined to an arch -- the fog is mostly transparent but relatively uniform.  The fogbow shape is created by those drops with the best angle to divert sunlight to the observer.  The fogbow\'s relative lack of colors are caused by the relatively smaller water drops.  The drops active above are so small that the quantum mechanical wavelength of light becomes important and smears out colors that would be created by larger rainbow water drops acting like small prisms reflecting sunlight.  The above striking image of a fogbow was taken last week with the Sun behind the photographer.
